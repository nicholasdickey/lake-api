Thermal scopes detect temperature via recognizing and capturing different levels of infrared light, while night vision scopes convert and amplify photons of light. Thermal scopes are rated for up to 4,000 yards, whereas night vision scopes are commonly restricted to 1,000 yards or less. Though night vision scopes are more affordable, the older the equipment, the lower the resolution of the image. Ultimately, the choice between night vision or thermal comes down to personal preference and budget. #outdoors</p><p>Jamey Caldwell, a veteran with years of experience working with night vision devices and now the founder of 1 Minute Out, teaches law enforcement and government agencies on the use of night vision devices. Caldwell, along with other experts in the field, recommends thermal scopes over night vision scopes for hunting due to their ability to highlight the animal from farther away. However, some experts still prefer night vision scopes and it comes down to the quality of the scope and the ability of the hunter behind the gun to accurately identify their target. When choosing between the two technologies, consider the range, cost, versatility and the pros and cons of each. #outdoors</p>",

He spent 21 years in the US Army, with the first seven serving in the 75th Ranger Regiment and 14 in a Special Missions Unit.&nbsp; He’s conducted over 500 direct action raids in his military career and now through his company, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.1minuteout.com/\">1 Minute Out</a>, he teaches law enforcement and government agencies different tactics, including the use of night vision devices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’d be hard pressed to find someone more qualified to break down the best night vision scopes available to civilians. But before you get too excited about night vision, Caldwell will tell you that <a href=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/gear/best-thermal-scopes/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">thermal scopes</a> trump night vision scopes in almost any situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My money is always on thermal anytime I go hunting at night—it’s always on thermal,” Caldwell says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, he notes, there are still many that prefer night vision scopes for hunting, and there’s a variety of devices available for that. Some other experts actually prefer night vision to thermal scopes, too. What works best for you will come down to your budget and your hunting preferences. I interviewed a couple night vision experts to get you started on finding the best night vision scope for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Best for ARs</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=14619&amp;pw=281801&amp;ctc=OL-RU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurooptic.com%2FEOTech-CNVD-LR-M2124-LR-Gen-III-Clip-On-Long-Range-Night-Vision-Device-M2124-LR.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">EOTech / L3 CNVD-LR (M2124-LR) Clip-On Night Vision &nbsp;</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Best Budget</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ATN-X-Sight-Ballistics-4056x3040-Resolution/dp/B0BQCH98KP?tag=camdenxodl-20&amp;asc_source=browser&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.outdoorlife.com%2Fgear%2Fbest-night-vision-scopes&amp;ascsubtag=0000OL0000245408O0000000020230520130000%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">ATN X-SIGHT 5 LRF 5-25X</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Best Multi-Use: </strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=14619&amp;pw=281801&amp;ctc=OL-RU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurooptic.com%2FEOTech-MonoNV-ESA-Gen-III-White-Phosphor-2376-Min-FOM-Night-Vision-Monocular-EOT.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">EOTech MonoNV, Night Vision PVS-14</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Best Clip-on: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://anvsinc.com/product/an-pvs-30-night-vision-weapon-sight/\">AN/PVS-30 Knight Vision Weapon Sight</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Best for Short Range Shooting</strong>: <a href=\"https://tnvc.com/shop/marauder-d750-4x-gen3-night-vision-scope/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">D750 Marauder 4X GEN3</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-night-vision-vs-thermal\">Night Vision vs. Thermal</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery alignwide has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\" data-dimension=\"portrait\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1975\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2023/05/19/NIGHTVISIONSCOPES-1-3-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Rifle Scopes photo\" class=\"wp-image-245460\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Night vision amplifies light.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\" data-dimension=\"portrait\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"978\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2021/09/22/opplanet-ir-scope-52121-pic3.jpeg\" alt=\"Thermal scope view.\" class=\"wp-image-162028\" srcset=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2021/09/22/opplanet-ir-scope-52121-pic3.jpeg 978w, https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2021/09/22/opplanet-ir-scope-52121-pic3-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2021/09/22/opplanet-ir-scope-52121-pic3-768x432.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Thermal displays differences in temperature.  <i>Optics Planet</i></figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply, night vision scopes convert and amplify photons of light, which means they require some degree of ambient light to function. Thermal scopes work by detecting temperature via recognizing and capturing different levels of infrared light through sensors on the scope. It displays the IR light as a thermogram (in other words, what you see in your scope). Think of it like the Predator’s vision he uses to take on Arnold Schwarzenegger and his heavily armed team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caldwell says thermal scopes highlight the animal from farther away, and make critters almost impossible to miss. Whereas with a night vision scope, you could miss the animals if you aren’t used to the black and white or green picture that it presents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caldwell says a combination of night vision goggles and a thermal scope, or an integrated night vision and thermal scope can make a formidable combination for hunting. But ultimately, he recommends thermal scopes over night vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’ve used very, very high end thermal stuff on the military side,” Caldwell says. “Now I’m seeing a lot of that technology and some really great gear come out on the civilian side.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all experts agree. Greg Coker served in the US Army for 22 years, with 15 years in the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. He has over 6,200 flight hours flying under night vision goggles and over 1,500 hours in combat. Coker says it depends on the quality of the scope you are using, and he prefers his <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=14619&amp;pw=281801&amp;ctc=OL-RU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurooptic.com%2FEOTech-MonoNV-ESA-Gen-III-White-Phosphor-2376-Min-FOM-Night-Vision-Monocular-EOT.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">Gen 3 PVS-14</a> for it’s better target identification. Coker says it comes down to the hunter behind the gun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“100% of it is the ability to identify what you’re going to shoot, and that’s based on weather, humidity, range—all those things come into play,” Coker says. “But, the dumbass behind the rifle needs to know for sure what they’re engaging.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coker takes people pig hunting at night quite often, and he regularly corrects people using thermal scopes. They’ll see an animal pop on their thermal device and immediately think it’s a pig, but often they’re looking at deer or raccoons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Range</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thermal scopes are rated for up to 4,000 yards, whereas a night vision scope is commonly restricted to 1,000 yards or less. But Coker’s point remains valid when it comes to the range of either scope: it comes down to how good the person behind the trigger is with identifying their targets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cost</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Night vision scopes range from budget-friendly to expensive, and most of the time you get what you pay for. The same goes for thermal scopes, but the most basic models run you more than your basic night vision scopes. A night vision scope can be as low as $200 while a basic thermal scope is around $500. A common factor for both night vision and thermal is the age of the devices greatly impacts performance. The older the equipment, the lower the resolution of your image.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Versatility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most night vision scopes are for nighttime only. Using them during the day will damage the optic and incur expensive repairs. Thermal scopes can be used during the day, but <a href=\"https://rdl.train.army.mil/catalog-ws/view/100.ATSC/BE842D10-198F-4595-8032-6E26C30A9284-1274577722006/7-21/chap6.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">two “crossover” periods</a> in a day render them blind. Crossover commonly occurs during sunrise and sunset, when most natural objects approach the same temperature, causing them all to blend together for a thermal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thermal scopes don’t require any sort of laser or an illuminated reticle, whereas night vision scopes need an infrared laser—sighted in with the scope—or an IR illuminated reticle on the scope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what kind of technology you’re using, taking a shot at anything without 100% confirmation of your target is irresponsible. When deciding what kind of scope you want, consider the different pros and cons of each, just like you would when selecting a rifle for deer hunting, or a broadhead for your elk hunt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/gear/best-thermal-scopes/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Best Thermal Scopes</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-night-vision-101\">Night Vision 101</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Night Vision devices are classified by generations, which are defined and regulated by the US Government.&nbsp; Each generation—called Gen 0, 1, 2, or 3—has technological advancements the previous generation does not. Hence, the older the night vision you have, the lower the quality will be. The experts I interviewed recommended buying Gen 3 or newer (Gen3 plus) night vision.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the advancements in technology, night vision scopes can function in low light environments, but they generally can’t function alone. So when you invest in a night vision scope, it’s likely not the only thing you will need to buy. With the more affordable night vision scopes, you’ll also need to purchase an IR-enabled crosshair or an IR laser to get accurate rounds on target.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-best-night-vision-scopes-recommendations\">Best Night Vision Scopes: Recommendations</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-best-for-ars-eotech-l3-cnvd-lr-m2124-lr\">Best for ARs: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=14619&amp;pw=281801&amp;ctc=OL-RU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurooptic.com%2FEOTech-CNVD-LR-M2124-LR-Gen-III-Clip-On-Long-Range-Night-Vision-Device-M2124-LR.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">EOTech / L3 CNVD-LR (M2124-LR)</a></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"ProductCardSimple\" data-id=\"ProductCardSimple\">\n  <div class=\"ProductCardSimple-image\">\n                          <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=14619&amp;pw=281801&amp;ctc=OL-RU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurooptic.com%2FEOTech-CNVD-LR-M2124-LR-Gen-III-Clip-On-Long-Range-Night-Vision-Device-M2124-LR.aspx\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer\">\n                    <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2023/05/19/EOTech-CNVD-LRM2124-LR.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=800&amp;crop=16:10,offset-x50\" data-image=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2023/05/19/EOTech-CNVD-LRM2124-LR.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=800&amp;crop=16:10,offset-x50\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Rifle Scopes photo\">\n                      </figure>\n                  </a>\n            </div>\n  <div class=\"ProductCardSimple-content\">\n          <div class=\"ProductCardSimple-contentDescription\">\n        <p><em>EOTech</em></p>\n\n      </div>\n              <p class=\"ProductCardSimple-contentBtnWrap\">\n        <a class=\"ProductCardSimple-contentBtn btn\" href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=14619&amp;pw=281801&amp;ctc=OL-RU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurooptic.com%2FEOTech-CNVD-LR-M2124-LR-Gen-III-Clip-On-Long-Range-Night-Vision-Device-M2124-LR.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SEE IT</a>\n      </p>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>$11,199.99</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gen 3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Recognition range relies on the daylight optic it’s attached to</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Optimized for 4-20x zoom&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Recoil rating up to 7.62mm</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Clip-on capability means no adjusting to obtain normal eye relief</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manual gain and focus enable user preference</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Single-throw Lever mount enables quick connect/disconnect</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5-year normal use warranty</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Only works inconjunction with a day optic</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Needs an adapter for AA batteries</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sight picture can be affected by the scope it is attached to</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The EOTech / L3 CNVD-LR comes from a company with a well-established history of providing reliable optics to the US Military and the civilian market.

The manual gain and focus allow for the user’s preferred image quality optimization. It is 10.7 inches long x 4.2 inches wide x 3.4 inches high and weighs 2.25 pounds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-best-on-a-budget-atn-x-sight-5-lrf-5-25x\">Best on a Budget: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ATN-X-Sight-Ballistics-4056x3040-Resolution/dp/B0BQCH98KP?tag=camdenxodl-20&amp;asc_source=browser&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.outdoorlife.com%2Fgear%2Fbest-night-vision-scopes&amp;ascsubtag=0000OL0000245408O0000000020230520130000%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">ATN X-Sight 5 LRF 5-25X</a></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"ProductCardSimple\" data-id=\"ProductCardSimple\">\n  <div class=\"ProductCardSimple-image\">\n                          <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ATN-X-Sight-Ballistics-4056x3040-Resolution/dp/B0BQCH98KP?tag=camdenxodl-20&amp;038%3Bascsubtag=0000OL0000245408O0000000020230520130000%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;asc_source=browser&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.outdoorlife.com%2Fgear%2Fbest-night-vision-scopes&amp;ascsubtag=0000OL0000245408O0000000020230520130000%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer\">\n                    <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2023/05/19/atn.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=800&amp;crop=16:10,offset-x50\" data-image=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2023/05/19/atn.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=800&amp;crop=16:10,offset-x50\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"ATN X-Sight\">\n                      </figure>\n                  </a>\n            </div>\n  <div class=\"ProductCardSimple-content\">\n          <div class=\"ProductCardSimple-contentDescription\">\n        <p><em>ATN</em></p>\n\n      </div>\n              <p class=\"ProductCardSimple-contentBtnWrap\">\n        <a class=\"ProductCardSimple-contentBtn btn\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ATN-X-Sight-Ballistics-4056x3040-Resolution/dp/B0BQCH98KP?tag=camdenxodl-20&amp;038%3Bascsubtag=0000OL0000245408O0000000020230520130000%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;asc_source=browser&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.outdoorlife.com%2Fgear%2Fbest-night-vision-scopes&amp;ascsubtag=0000OL0000245408O0000000020230520130000%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SEE IT</a>\n      </p>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>$1,195</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ATN ‘Gen 5’ digital scope.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Recognition range up to 150 yds with a standard IR light.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Digital screen</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Option for plug-in extended battery</li>\n\n\n\n<li>User customizable reticle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Day and night modes</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2 year warranty</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Budget friendly option</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Customer service is quick to address any issues</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Laser range finder with auto-adjustments</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Controls are on top of the scope and you have to break sight picture to adjust</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can have a variety of glitches in the firmware</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For those looking to make a small investment to check out a night vision scope, the ATN X-Sight 5 is a budget friendly option. The scope’s different modes allows for day or nighttime hunting. The 4K+ sensor allows a display of 4056×3040. With recoil activated slow motion, you can capture your hunts at point of impact.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ATN’s X-sight 5 LRF operates in extreme temperatures at -20 to 120 degrees. This scope totes a 5-25x magnification, but several reviews state the higher magnification is poor quality. At 2.2 pounds and 15.2 inches long x 3 inches wide x 2.2 inches high, this scope won’t weigh down your rifle too much. I recommend that you replace the scope rings with higher quality ones to avoid any issues common with ATN’s provided rings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recording options of 30, 60, and 120 frames per second allow for regular or slow motion filming. ATN has built in a wifi transfer capability so you can share your videos and photos with you friends. Its built-in laser range finder will automatically adjust for windage and distance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As stated up above, the lower the price point increases the likelihood of quality issues, but you are covered under a <a href=\"https://www.atncorp.com/rma\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">two-year warranty</a> and ATN’s rockstar customer service team when you purchase this scope.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-best-multi-use-eotech-mononv-night-vision-pvs-14\">Best Multi-Use: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=14619&amp;pw=281801&amp;ctc=OL-RU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurooptic.com%2FEOTech-MonoNV-ESA-Gen-III-White-Phosphor-2376-Min-FOM-Night-Vision-Monocular-EOT.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">EOTech MonoNV, Night Vision PVS-14</a></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"ProductCardSimple\" data-id=\"ProductCardSimple\">\n  <div class=\"ProductCardSimple-image\">\n                          <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=14619&amp;pw=281801&amp;ctc=OL-RU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurooptic.com%2FEOTech-MonoNV-ESA-Gen-III-White-Phosphor-2376-Min-FOM-Night-Vision-Monocular-EOT.aspx\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer\">\n                    <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2023/05/19/pvs-14.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=800&amp;crop=16:10,offset-x50\" data-image=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2023/05/19/pvs-14.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=800&amp;crop=16:10,offset-x50\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Rifle Scopes photo\">\n                      </figure>\n                  </a>\n            </div>\n  <div class=\"ProductCardSimple-content\">\n              <p class=\"ProductCardSimple-contentBtnWrap\">\n        <a class=\"ProductCardSimple-contentBtn btn\" href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=14619&amp;pw=281801&amp;ctc=OL-RU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurooptic.com%2FEOTech-MonoNV-ESA-Gen-III-White-Phosphor-2376-Min-FOM-Night-Vision-Monocular-EOT.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SEE IT</a>\n      </p>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>$4,999</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gen 3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Recognition range: With good conditions, man size target at 100-150m</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Quick-Release dovetail mount</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gen3 technology.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adjustable diopter of +2 to -6</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1x scope.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Automatic Brightness Control and Bright Light Cut-Off</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2376 minimum FOM</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compact and lightweight at 10.6 oz&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Water resistant down to 66 ft. up to one hour&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Meets the rigorous testing of the US Military’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.junipersys.com/mil-std-810g/\">Mil-Std 810G</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Needs a scope with an IR crosshair or an IR laser</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reliable product from EOTECH with a price point of $4,999, the PVS-14 provides flexibility that meets the military’s highest rugged standards for their equipment (MIL-STD-810G). This is Coker’s go-to setup. He’s attached it to his crossbow, shotguns, and rifles since 2008. He’s yet to experience any failures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\" data-dimension=\"landscape\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2023/05/19/NIGHTVISIONSCOPES-1-2-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"PVS-14 Night Vision Scope on a crossbow.\" class=\"wp-image-245461\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A PVS-14 mounted behind a crossbow day optic.  <i>Joshua Skovlund</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The PVS-14 can be hand-held, helmet or head-mounted, and weapon mounted. Its ESA Gen 3 White Phosphor tube technology provides a clear picture at night and will maintain a zero with your preferred anytime optic. At 10.6 oz. and 4.6 in. long x 2.1 wide x 2.9 high, this OG night vision clip-on won’t weigh your pack down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its diopter range of +2 to -6 and a minimum focus range of 9.8 in. allows for the use to dial in their sight picture for a shot on a coyote or to pick up important documents off a table.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coker says he will use his PVS-14 over any thermal scope. His first crossbow pig was shot through a T1 Aimpoint red dot and the PVS-14.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I posted a picture on social media, and everybody went crazy over it,” Coker says. “They’re like, ‘You got to be the first dude in the world to get a night vision bow kill on a pig!’”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically under good conditions a 1x image intensifier tube system will allow detection of a man-size target at 100-150 meters and recognition of a man at 80-100 meters. With the aid of a quality illuminator you can safely triple the detection range and double the recognition range, provided the user’s eyes are capable and the device is properly focused and utilized.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-best-clip-on-an-pvs-30-knight-vision-weapon-sight\">Best Clip-on: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://anvsinc.com/product/an-pvs-30-night-vision-weapon-sight/\">AN/PVS-30 Knight Vision Weapon Sight</a></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"ProductCardSimple\" data-id=\"ProductCardSimple\">\n  <div class=\"ProductCardSimple-image\">\n                          <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://anvsinc.com/product/an-pvs-30-night-vision-weapon-sight/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer\">\n                    <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2023/05/19/PVS-30.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=800&amp;crop=16:10,offset-x50\" data-image=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2023/05/19/PVS-30.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=800&amp;crop=16:10,offset-x50\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Rifle Scopes photo\">\n                      </figure>\n                  </a>\n            </div>\n  <div class=\"ProductCardSimple-content\">\n          <div class=\"ProductCardSimple-contentDescription\">\n        <p><em>ANVS</em></p>\n\n      </div>\n              <p class=\"ProductCardSimple-contentBtnWrap\">\n        <a class=\"ProductCardSimple-contentBtn btn\" href=\"https://anvsinc.com/product/an-pvs-30-night-vision-weapon-sight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SEE IT</a>\n      </p>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>$11,495</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gen 3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Recognition range relies on the daylight optic it’s attached to</li>\n\n\n\n<li>No rifle or optic alteration required</li>\n\n\n\n<li>KAC mount or quick attach /detach to MIL-STD-1913 rail or equivalent.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Optimized for medium and long range scopes up to 20x</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rated for large caliber sniper rifles up to .50 caliber</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>.5 MOA.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Recognition range out to approximately 1,094 yards</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gen3 technology</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manual gain and focus control</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Heavy at 2.9 pounds</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Custom order; delayed shipping</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With a price point of $11,495.00, the AN/PVS-30 Knight Vision Weapon Sight is a top of the line clip-on night vision sight. Its .5 MOA enables extreme precision that snipers in federal and military units seek out. You won’t need to make any adjustments in eye relief or the position of your cheek weld as it mounts to the front of your prime optic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AN/PVS-30 clip-on module is optimized and tested for medium and long-range sniper weapons, including .50 caliber rifles and scopes with magnification up to 20x. At 2.9 pounds and 9.6 inches long, this will add some weight to your rifle but it’s not much different from other clip-on options—something to keep in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The focus range spans 20 meters to infinity and the on/off gain control and focus ring allows the user to dial in their desired clarity. This clip-on is powered by one AA battery that grants more than 24 hours of continual use; or one 123 battery that grants 36 hours of continual use. If you are looking to make a major investment in a clip-on night vision sight, this is the one for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"h-best-for-short-range-shooting-d750-marauder-4x-gen-3\">Best for Short Range Shooting: <a href=\"https://tnvc.com/shop/marauder-d750-4x-gen3-night-vision-scope/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">D750 Marauder 4X Gen 3</a></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"ProductCardSimple\" data-id=\"ProductCardSimple\">\n  <div class=\"ProductCardSimple-image\">\n                          <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tnvc.com/shop/marauder-d750-4x-gen3-night-vision-scope/\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer\">\n                    <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\n            <img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2023/05/19/d750.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=800&amp;crop=16:10,offset-x50\" data-image=\"https://www.outdoorlife.com/uploads/2023/05/19/d750.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=800&amp;crop=16:10,offset-x50\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"auto\" alt=\"Rifle Scopes photo\">\n                      </figure>\n                  </a>\n            </div>\n  <div class=\"ProductCardSimple-content\">\n          <div class=\"ProductCardSimple-contentDescription\">\n        <p><em>B&amp;H Photo</em></p>\n\n      </div>\n              <p class=\"ProductCardSimple-contentBtnWrap\">\n        <a class=\"ProductCardSimple-contentBtn btn\" href=\"https://tnvc.com/shop/marauder-d750-4x-gen3-night-vision-scope/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SEE IT</a>\n      </p>\n      </div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>$5,595.00.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gen 3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Recognition range of 350 meters</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matte black finish that minimizes light reflection.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4x magnification</li>\n\n\n\n<li>High definition multi-coated lenses for ultra-clear resolution</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Manual gain control</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Auto-gated</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Resolution 64-72 lp/mm</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Adjustable dual throw-lever mechanism for quick attach/detach function</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2 year warranty</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Detection of target out to 1,000 meters</li>\n\n\n\n<li>True target identification at 350 meters</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Limited inventory (backorder currently)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4 lbs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>No daylight hunting</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The D750 Marauder 4x Gen3 night vision scope is a top contender on the market for nighttime optics. With a price of $5,595.00, it’s middle of the road in terms of cost. The housing of the scope is waterproof, nitrogen purge-capable, and will hold a zero regardless of the recoil of the rifle it’s attached to. The D750 Marauder is rated for use with up to a .50 BMG. It has a 2-year warranty, you won’t have to worry about early repairs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its Gen3 technology provides a pristine picture, giving you all the power in the world to get a fast ID on feral pigs or coyotes. It features a night vision enabled crosshair so that you won’t need a laser on your rifle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scope is 9 inches long x 3.5 inches wide x 4 inches high. Weighing only 2.38 pounds, it provides a 4x magnification, a 10-degree view, and a resolution of 64-72 lp/mm typical. The scope has a matte black, corrosion-resistant coating and is waterproof. Its diopter range of +3 to -4 provides focus abilities for those with corrective lenses; its focus range is 33 feet to infinity. Powered by two AA batteries, this scope will run at room temperature for up to 60 hours of nonstop hunting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-night-vision-scope\">Things to Consider Before Buying a Night Vision Scope</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you only want to hunt at night, or do you want something that can function both day and night? If it’s night hunting you are after, a night vision scope can be a good fit. Just keep in mind that you will need an IR-enabled crosshair or an IR laser to get accurate rounds on target.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So ultimately, do your research and make sure you have the budget to buy everything you need to hunt at night. You should also consider getting formal training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jon Dufresne served in the US Army, with the majority of his time volunteering as a Ranger. He deployed four times with 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. Now, he runs <a href=\"https://www.kinetic-consulting.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kinetic Consulting</a>, a company that teaches tactics—including the use of night vision—to civilians, law enforcement, and federal agencies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He offers his students a chance to rent night vision so they can test it out before committing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“​​Instead of buying your own set, you could actually just go ahead and rent a set, which is kind of cool,” Dufresne says. “So it offers a different perspective on ‘how can I get into this,’ and ‘do I want this?’ It gives the student almost like a flavor test playing around with it for a weekend.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shooting at night doesn’t come naturally for most of us. Dufresne runs his classes so that people start with the basics of shooting, which he calls “mechanics.” From there, the students can advance into the more tactical heavy classes like shooting under night vision. The only way you can get better is by getting the reps in, training like the pros by mastering the basics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dufresne points out that you should consider calling the company you are wishing to buy from first, to make sure the device you’re looking at will function in the environment you’re hunting in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Down in South Florida, there’s something called [Equivalent Background Illumination], and it is very important for my situation because I have a lot of humidity in the air—all the particles of water in the air reflect light to a certain extent,” Dufresne says. “So I have to be able to see through those or push my vision past those in a way.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, you have to store your night vision devices in a dark place. When they are exposed to harsh light for extended periods of time, they can be damaged and incur hefty and expensive repairs. This can manifest in the form of black dots or honeycomb looking imprints in the sight picture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this happens, you should place it in a box that blocks out all light and leave for a few days. If that doesn’t resolve your sight picture abnormalities, you’ll likely need professional repairs. Caldwell recommends sending in any night vision device to a certified repair company at least once a year to make sure you are staying ahead of any wear and tear damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-faqs\">FAQs</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block\"><div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1684519453183\"><h3 class=\"schema-faq-question\">Q: <strong>What’s better, night vision or thermal scopes?</strong></h3> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">This isn’t what most people like to hear, but it depends. Thermal scopes have a greater recognition range compared to night vision scopes, but can the shooter truly identify what they are seeing?&nbsp; The answer boils down to shooter preference.</p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1684519469973\"><h3 class=\"schema-faq-question\">Q: <strong>Can a night vision scope be used in the daylight?</strong></h3> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">No, using a night vision scope during the day, that is not a digital scope, will damage it and the sensors will be overwhelmed to the point you can’t see anything. Digital scopes have day and night modes, but the daylight mode of digital scopes does not use night vision technology.</p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1684519486747\"><h3 class=\"schema-faq-question\">Q: <strong>How much does a night vision scope cost?</strong></h3> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">Anywhere from $1,000 to $15,000. Heed the experts’ warning: you get what you pay for.</p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1684519503545\"><h3 class=\"schema-faq-question\">Q: <strong>How do night vision scopes work?</strong></h3> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">The scope gathers available photons of light through the objective lens and then into the image intensifier tubes where it’s converted to electrons. The electrons are multiplied, or amplified, and displayed on phosphor (white or green) at the backend of the tube.&nbsp;</p> </div> </div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-final-thoughts-on-the-best-night-vision-scopes\">Final Thoughts on the Best Night Vision Scopes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want a solid optic for hunting at night, consider night vision, but if you want a day-and-night scope, maybe thermal is best. Remember, quality night vision gear is expensive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You’re paying for what you get,” Coker says. “If you buy cheap, you’re gonna get cheap.”<br>When looking at the range of the night vision scope, remember that even if it can detect targets out to 1,000 yards, that doesn’t mean you will have a clear picture to take a shot. Weather conditions can adversely affect the night vision scope sight picture. Hunt safely and responsibly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find companies near you that offer a chance to try out the tech before purchasing, or sign up for one of Dufresne or Caldwell’s classes if they are in your area. This could save you a lot of heartache over an expensive purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Best for ARs</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=14619&amp;pw=281801&amp;ctc=OL-RU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurooptic.com%2FEOTech-CNVD-LR-M2124-LR-Gen-III-Clip-On-Long-Range-Night-Vision-Device-M2124-LR.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">EOTech / L3 CNVD-LR (M2124-LR) Clip-On Night Vision &nbsp;</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Best Budget</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ATN-X-Sight-Ballistics-4056x3040-Resolution/dp/B0BQCH98KP?tag=camdenxodl-20&amp;asc_source=browser&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.outdoorlife.com%2Fgear%2Fbest-night-vision-scopes&amp;ascsubtag=0000OL0000245408O0000000020230520130000%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">ATN X-SIGHT 5 LRF 5-25X</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Best Multi-use Night Vision Device: </strong><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=14619&amp;pw=281801&amp;ctc=OL-RU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurooptic.com%2FEOTech-MonoNV-ESA-Gen-III-White-Phosphor-2376-Min-FOM-Night-Vision-Monocular-EOT.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow\">EOTech MonoNV, Night Vision PVS-14</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Best Clip-on: </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://anvsinc.com/product/an-pvs-30-night-vision-weapon-sight/\">AN/PVS-30 Knight Vision Weapon Sight</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Best for Short Range Shooting</strong>: <a href=\"https://tnvc.com/shop/marauder-d750-4x-gen3-night-vision-scope/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">D750 Marauder 4X GEN3</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n      "

The Angeles National Forest is the perfect example of that. If you love riding four-wheelers on rugged terrains, I highly recommend checking out the Angeles National Forest. However, you should make sure to bring a camera with you (or a smartphone that takes good pictures) because the trail offers stunning views of the San Gabriel Mountains that will leave you in awe.</p><span class=\"ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content\"></span><blockquote><p><strong>Join our Facebook Group of ATV fans</strong> <strong>today</strong> to connect with a community of like-minded people.

If that is the case, I recommend the Rowher Flat Area ATV route in Los Angeles. What makes this route perfect for long distance four-wheelers is the fact that it features more than 50 miles of trails with varying levels of difficulty. So, whether you are a beginner or a veteran off-road rider, you are guaranteed to have fun. Since my list covers the most scenic routes in Los Angeles, it should come as no surprise that it’s packed with beautiful landscapes that feature oak woodlands, sagebrush, and vistas of the surrounding mountains.</p><h3><strong>#3 <a href=\"http://ohv.parks.ca.gov/hungryvalley/\">Hungry Valley State Vehicular Recreation Area</a></strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3><p><img data-id=\"fixed-image\" src=\"undefined\" srcset=\"undefined\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" alt=\"Hungry Valley State Vehicular Recreation Area\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>Right from the get-go, I need to mention that you need to set at least two days to see the entirety of Hungry Valley State Vehicular Recreation Area. The ATV route features 130 miles of marked trails that cover all terrains imaginable. This is why you should make sure to <a href=\"https://atv-outdoors.com/what-to-wear-when-atv-riding-a-beginners-guide/\">wear the right ATV gear</a> when going on this route. Nonetheless, what I really like about the Hungry Valley State Vehicular Recreation Area is that it’s a perfect destination for all skill levels. It starts with sandy washes and ends with steep hills that will test any ATV rider’s meddle.</p><h3><strong>#4<a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5286219.pdf\"> Littlerock Dam Recreation Area</a></strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3><p><img data-id=\"fixed-image\" src=\"undefined\" srcset=\"undefined\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" alt=\"Littlerock Dam Recreation Area\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>It’s been challenging to determine the position I should place Littlerock Dam Recreation Area in my top 10 most scenic routes in Los Angeles. This is because the ATV route is stunningly beautiful, but it’s not the best destination for beginner riders. The trails are a bit tricky, and if you have yet to <a href=\"https://atv-outdoors.com/how-to-steer-an-atv-a-beginner-friendly-guide/\">master steering on your ATV</a>, the tight corners might be problematic. However, I can’t deny that the views in Littlerock Dam Recreation Area are not breathtaking. This is why it’s sitting on the #4 spot.</p><span class=\"ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content\"></span><span style=\"clear:both;display:block\" id=\"ez-clearholder-large-leaderboard-2\"></span><h3><strong>#5 <a href=\"https://www.blm.gov/visit/el-mirage-ohv-area\">El Mirage Dry Lake OHV Area</a></strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3><p><img data-id=\"fixed-image\" src=\"undefined\" srcset=\"undefined\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" alt=\"El Mirage Dry Lake OHV Area\" width=\"100%\"></p><span class=\"ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content\"></span><span style=\"clear:both;display:block\" id=\"ez-clearholder-leader-1\"></span><p>On the fifth spot, we have the amazing El Mirage Dry Lake OHV Area that never fails to impress with its expansive dry lake bed. The lake bed is ideal for ATV riders who want to test the top speed of their ATVs. Furthermore, the ATV route is surrounded by a picturesque desert landscape that makes for a one-of-a-kind ATV riding experience. I should warn you that since you will be riding in open space most of the time, the sun will get quite hot. Make sure to bring enough water and avoid riding at peak sun hours.</p><h3><strong>#6 <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/lpnf/recarea/?recid=11016\">Ballinger Canyon OHV Area</a></strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3><p><img data-id=\"fixed-image\" src=\"undefined\" srcset=\"undefined\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" alt=\"Ballinger Canyon OHV Area\" width=\"100%\"></p><p>Are you the type of rider who enjoys difficult forest trails? If yes, Ballinger Canyon OHV Area is what you are looking for. This is one of the most scenic routes in the entire country, and you can find it located in the Los Padres National Forest.

However, the guide doesn’t apply to all off-road situations. ATV mudding can quickly turn messy and this is why you need to prepare a set of mudding clothes. Wearing the proper mudding clothing will not only keep you safe and comfortable but also make the experience more fun.</p><p><strong>ATV mudding gear needs to include the following:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Helmet;</strong></li><li><strong>Googles (or a face shield);</strong></li><li><strong>Gloves;</strong></li><li><strong>Waterproof jacket (or long-sleeve shirt);</strong><span class=\"ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph\"></span></li><li><strong>Waterproof boots;</strong><span class=\"ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content\"></span></li><li><strong>Long pants.</strong></li></ul><p>Wearing the right type of clothing is essential to have a fun time when ATV mudding. Otherwise, you will have a bad time washing dry mud off your skin. Now, let’s go ahead and see why each piece of gear I listed is necessary when ATV mudding.</p><h2><strong>What to Wear When ATV Mudding: A Comprehensive Guide</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2><p><img data-id=\"fixed-image\" src=\"undefined\" srcset=\"undefined\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" alt=\"ATV riders with proper mudding gear\" width=\"100%\"></p><span class=\"ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7\"></span><span style=\"clear:both;display:block\" id=\"ez-clearholder-large-mobile-banner-1\"></span><p>ATV mudding is fun and there is no doubt about that. However, the experience can go bad if you are not wearing the best mud riding clothes and gear. Below, I will break down everything that you need to wear when ATV mudding so that you have a good time.</p><span class=\"ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph\"></span><blockquote><p><strong>Join our Facebook Group of ATV fans</strong> <strong>today</strong> to connect with a community of like-minded people. All questions you might have about ATVs will be answered in the group. Don’t miss out on the fun – <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/578295997608656/\">CLICK HERE</a> to join now!</p></blockquote><ul><li><h3><strong>Helmet</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3></li></ul><p>No matter where you might be headed with your four-wheeler, you have to wear a helmet. In fact, you can’t even get on public roads without having a helmet because you will be stopped by police. Nonetheless, the reason why a DOT-approved helmet is crucial for ATV mudding is to keep you safe in case you fall off the four-wheeler or mud debris hits your head. In my opinion, the best type of ATV helmets are those with adjustable chin straps so that you get the perfect fit.</p><span class=\"ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph\"></span><ul><li><h3><strong>Goggles</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3></li></ul><p>If you have never been ATV mudding before, I guarantee you will be surprised by how far mud is thrown in the air when you hit the gas. Goggles (or a face shield if your helmet supports one) is essential for mud riding. If goggles are not available, you should consider, at the very least, wearing a pair of sunglasses so that mud doesn’t get in your eyes.</p><ul><li><h3><strong>Gloves</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3></li></ul><p>Riding four-wheelers through mud is difficult. You will be pulling on the handlebars with all your force. Therefore, bringing a pair of gloves is always a good idea when going mudding. You will have a better grip on the handlebars and it will be easier to keep your hands warm and dry.</p><ul><li><h3><strong>Waterproof Jacket or Long-Sleeve Shirt</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3></li></ul><p>Investing in a waterproof jacket is one of the best things you can do if you love ATV riding. You never know when it might start raining on the trail. When it comes to mudding, you should never do it while wearing a simple t-shirt. You need to have a waterproof jacket over or a long-sleeve shirt if you can’t get a jacket at the moment. Trust me. Getting dry mud off your skin is an experience you want to skip!</p><span class=\"ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph\"></span><ul><li><h3><strong>Waterproof Boots</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3></li></ul><p>Your boots will get dirt when mudding and there is no other way around it. This is why getting a waterproof pair is a great choice. I highly recommend buying a pair that comes with angle protection and slip-resistant soles so that you can ride the ATV in all environments. I wrote a full beginner’s guide on <a href=\"https://atv-outdoors.com/do-you-need-riding-boots-for-atv-best-choice-included/\">why you should wear ATV boots</a>, in case you are interested in reading more.</p><ul><li><h3><strong>Long Pants</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3></li></ul><p>The final clothing item that needs to be on your “must have” list for ATV mudding is a pair of long pants. You can always wear a regular pair of jeans that you don’t mind getting dirty, but the best choice for ATV riding are pants with reinforced knees. They are more expensive though. If you are not comfortable in jeans, I recommend wearing pants that are made from a breathable material like nylon, for example.</p><h2><strong>Why It’s Important to Wear Mudding Clothes (and not regular clothing)</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2><p>The main reason why you want to wear mudding clothes instead of regular clothing is because of safety. Being equipped with proper gear when ATV mudding will make the difference between having fun or getting hurt. Here is why it’s important to wear ATV mudding clothes:</p><span class=\"ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content\"></span><span style=\"clear:both;display:block\" id=\"ez-clearholder-banner-1\"></span><ul><li><h3><strong>Safety</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3></li></ul><p>As fun ATV mudding can be, you can’t overlook that it’s dangerous as well. Since the four-wheeler is sliding everywhere in mud, there are more chances than ever to fall off and get hurt. This is why you need to wear a helmet!</p><ul><li><h3><strong>Comfort</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3></li></ul><p>Mudding gear is more comfortable than regular clothing. I guarantee that you will have a better time on your ATV if you decide to wear breathable clothes that you don’t care about getting dirty. In addition, wearing a pair of goggles will ensure that you can focus on the fun without being distracted by mud getting into your eyes.</p><ul><li><h3><strong>You Will Do Better</strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h3></li></ul><p>Besides safety and comfort, wearing mudding gear such as a helmet, gear, and goggles can also make it easier to control the four-wheeler, even though you might be going through mud. For example, the protection gloves will give you a better grip while the goggles will help with your vision.</p><span class=\"ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content\"></span><h2><strong>Final Thoughts </strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"></span></h2><p>ATV mudding is an exciting and adrenaline-pumping activity that will get the hearts of all off-road enthusiasts going. However, it’s essential to prioritize safety and comfort by wearing the appropriate mudding clothing. If you follow the guide I presented today and wear all the items I showcased, you will be ready to tackle muddy trails and have a fun experience. So gear up, stay safe, and enjoy the ride!</p>"
